                I would like to highlight part three, chapter one in How to Win Friends and Influence People, 
                entitled “You Can't Win an Argument.” In this chapter, Dale Carnegie says that arguments are largely useless - 
                they do more harm than good. He tells a story of the time he was listening to a man tell a story at a banquet. 
                The man used a quote that he claimed was from the Bible, but Dale knew that it was from Shakespeare, not the Bible. 
                He interrupted the man and told him that the quote was from Shakespeare, not the Bible. The man disagreed, claiming 
                that he knew for certain that it was from the Bible. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Dale's friend, who sat to his left, had studied Shakespeare thoroughly throughout his life and also knew that the man 
                was wrong. Despite this, he chimed in and agreed with the man, letting Dale know that he was wrong to think that the 
                quote was from Shakespeare.
                <br>
                <br>
                As they were leaving the party, Dale asked his friend why he had defended the man when he knew he was wrong, 
                and he said, “Why prove to a man he is wrong? Is that going to make him like you? He didn't ask for your opinion.” 
                <br>
                <br>
                Earlier in the chapter, Dale mentioned how he much he enjoyed debating and arguing with others - 
                so much so that he was considering writing a book about it. Now I would never write a book about arguing, but I enjoy 
                debating topics with others. 
                <br>
                <br>
                A couple of weeks ago, I entered into a heated debate with my roommate about whether or not USC should make 
                the College Football Playoff. He had some good points, and I had mine. However, instead of feeling enlightened and 
                content when the argument was over, I felt a little annoyed that he thought he knew better than me. Shortly after, I 
                thought back to this chapter and recognized my mistake. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This book has helped me realize that there is a time and a place for arguing. Too often, tempers flare and 
                enemies are made when an argument is takes place. I plan to further explore when a debate is appropriate and how to 
                conduct myself so as to keep my friends.

              <h4>What {{ response|capfirst }} Learned: </h4>
              <br>
              <p class="lead mb-0" style="font-size: 20px">
                Something I learned from the reading comes from the chapter, "A Simple Way to Make a Good First Impression.” In this chapter, Carnegie 
                argues that making a good first impression is crucial because it sets the tone for the rest of your interaction with someone. 
                If you make a poor first impression, it can be difficult to recover and build a positive relationship.
                <br>
                <br>
                Carnegie suggests that the key to making a good first impression is to focus on the other person and show genuine interest 
                in them. This means asking questions and actively listening to their answers, rather than simply talking about yourself. 
                By showing the other person that you are interested in them and what they have to say, you can create a positive impression 
                and lay the foundation for a successful relationship.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, it's important to avoid being fake. Carnegie suggests it's just as important to be yourself when making a first 
                impression. This means being authentic and genuine, rather than trying to put on an act or impress the other person with false 
                statements. By being yourself, you can show the other person that you are trustworthy and sincere.
                <br>
                <br>
                In my own life, I have found that making a good first impression is crucial in both personal and professional interactions. 
                I try to focus on the other person and show genuine interest in them by asking questions and actively listening to their answers. 
                <br>
                <br>
                These strategies have helped me to make a good first impression in a variety of situations, from meeting new people at social 
                events to interviewing for a job. By creating a positive first impression, I have been able to build strong relationships with 
                others and establish a positive reputation for myself.

              <h4>What {{ response|capfirst }} Learned: </h4>
              <br>
              <p class="lead mb-0" style="font-size: 20px">
                I learned a lot this semester from reading How to Win Friends and Influence People, but I think the most impactful 
                things that I was able to learn and apply was to not directly contradict people. The stories shared in both the 
                sections covering these topics were awesome, I especially loved reading about the progression Ben Franklin made 
                from a very unagreeable man to one of the most affable and open minded individuals in the history of our country.
                <br>
                <br> 
                I don't feel that I'm a very disagreeable person, but I do enjoy being right and having that acknowledged. However, 
                after reading, “A Sure Way of Making Enemies and How to Avoid It”, I have been conscious to avoid directly contradicting 
                my roommates, group members, and everyone else I interact with daily and the results were pretty cool. I work at the BYU 
                Store and frequently get told by customers that they've seen or heard about certain items we carry in the store that I 
                know we don't. In the past, I'd simply expressed this to them which led to disbelief, aggravation, and them asking me 
                impatiently to check our systems. I changed my tactic in these situations now and my experience with the customers has 
                improved vastly. Rather than saying we don't carry something, I might say something to the effect of, “Oh, I don't think 
                I've seen something like that before, but I'd love to check our inventory for it really quickly.” Then I check the computer 
                systems and confirm we don't have it. Rather than frustration and annoyance, customers much more frequently express 
                gratitude for my willingness to help. Plus, sometimes I'm wrong and then I've learned something and the customer gets what 
                they want. 
                <br>
                <br>
                By not directly telling others they're wrong, and by keeping yourself open to the possibility that you could be 
                incorrect, you help others opinions to change easier to match your own, or you'll learn something you understood incorrectly 
                before.

              <h4>What {{ response|capfirst }} Learned: </h4>
              <br>
              <p class="lead mb-0" style="font-size: 20px">
                My favorite chapters of this book were very close to the beginning, and I think that was
                for good reason. These fundamental blocks of greater relationships with people are so vitally
                important to implement in our daily lives. Whether it be in the business world or in our day-to-
                day affairs, being genuinely interested in someone and their wellbeing, goals, and passions, and
                remembering their name goes such a long way.
                <br>
                <br>
                I feel like I've always had a slight advantage in the name department. For some odd
                reason I have quite an exceptional ability to remember names, especially if I can link it to a face.
                I have noticed that I often see people from my past and address them by their name and they,
                more likely than not, don't even remember who I am. In fact, this happened just yesterday. I
                had run into my ex-girlfriend's old roommate, whom I hadn't seen or talked to in over 2 years. I
                was able to call her by name, and even ask her if she was still pursuing her music major. I don't
                write this to brag, but to try to explain the look on her face. She lit up when she realized who I
                was and was shocked I still remembered her interests.
                <br>
                <br>
                I've tried to apply this principle to my everyday life, maybe not so much remembering
                names, but using names of people that I run into throughout the day. Every retail, fast-food, or
                service-oriented job usually has employees wearing name tags. I started calling people by their
                names when I thanked them or addresses them, and they were always so surprised. They often
                don't get people saying their name in a manner like that, and I think that is so sad. The slightest
                little thing, one extra word, can make someone's day and instantly make them remember you.
                It made me think of other behaviors that or so small, but people just don't do.
                <br>
                <br>
                I think that is what I learned the most. If you want to influence people and have people
                like you, do the small things that others don't. “Common courtesy” really isn't so common in
                society anymore, but I think that is really the whole point of the book. Stand out from others by
                going the extra mile, not for yourself, but for the individuals you meet every day. Try to change
                their life and your life will be changed. Christ never sought his own pleasure, recognition, or
                fame. His audience and gathering came from his service to others. Service that stood out of the
                crowds. Be different and people will notice you're different - and appreciate you for it.
